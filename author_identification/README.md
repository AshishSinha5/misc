# Author Indentification via NLP Techniques

This project aims to explore various text classification techniques in NLP literature. Here I apply suit of NLP algorithms to solve the problem of Author Identification using exerpts from their 
literary works. 

## Workflow/Experiments

- ML models
  - Logistic (with tfidf, cntvec, glove)
  - NB (with tfidf and cntvec)
  - XGboost (with glove, tfidf, cntvec)
  - Tuening
- DL models
  - Embedding Bag model
  - Entity Embedding mode;
  - Glove embedding model
    - normalized 
    - un-normalized 
  - Tuning with optuna
- Pretrained Model
  - Tranformers
